# TODO: 2 * qv1 is not implemented
# TODO: Creating dimensionless quantities is difficult

# Promising benchmarks:
# basic arithmetic is ~2x faster than astropy.units,
# quantity creation is ~10x faster than astropy.units.
# composite unit creation is ~1.2x faster than astropy.units.

# This was Step 0
# Step 1: Use faster vector (numpy.array?) and fraction arithmetic (cfractions?) (done)
# stdlib.fractions + Vector gave decent performance, but rational dtype with NumPy arrays was better

# Step 2: Figure out dimensionless quantities (including angles)
# Step 3: Mathematical operations (NumPy ufuncs) including angles (conversion to radians)
# Step 4: Try more micro optimizations (compile with Cython?)
# Step 5: Complete SI units
# Step 6: Different CODATA versions
